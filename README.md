# polling-accuracy

Exploratory data analysis of polling accuracy.

- `notebook-1.ipynb` - [should be done already] helps you become familiar with the data. Read through it and answer the questions. (There isn't any coding involved in this notebook, unless you really want to!)
- `notebook-2.ipynb` - [~15 mins] gets you started with using `ggplot2` to explore this dataset
- `notebook-3.ipynb` - is a guided exploratory analysis, it asks you to try and answer a few questions
- `notebook-4.ipynb` - Create at least three exploratory data visualizations and answer all of the reflection questions.

Note: If you see a 👉 emoji, that likely means you need to write an answer!
